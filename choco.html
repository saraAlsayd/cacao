                    <h3>milk choclate</h3>
                    <p>Milk chocolate is perhaps the most popular type of chocolate. <br>
                        It actually contains only ten to 40 percent cacao mixed with <br> sugar and
                        milk (either condensed milk or milk solids). <br> Milk chocolate is much, <br>
                        much sweeter than dark or bitttersweet chocolate and has <br>
                        a lighter color and less-pronounced chocolate taste.</p>

                    <h3>White Chocolate</h3>
                    <p>White chocolate does not contain chocolate <br>
                        liquor or any other cocoa products besides <br>
                        cocoa butter. It doesn’t have a very chocolatey <br>
                        taste, but resembles smooth vanilla. White chocolate <br>
                        contains a minimum 20 percent cocoa butter, a maximum of <br>
                        55 percent sugar, and about 15 percent milk solids.</p>

                    <h3> Dark Chocolate</h3>
                    <p>Dark chocolate contains chocolate liquor, sugar,<br>
                        and cocoa butter. It also commonly includes lecithin <br>
                        as an emulsifier and vanilla for flavor. Dark chocolate <br>
                        does not contain any milk solids. The amount of cocoa in <br>
                        dark chocolate bars ranges from 30 percent all the way up <br>
                        to 80 percent. Bittersweet chocolate and semi-sweet <br>
                        chocolate are also technically “dark chocolate,” <br>
                        but are used for baking purposes.</p>

                    <h3> Semisweeet Chocolate</h3>
                    <p>Semisweet chocolate contains at least 35 percent cocoa <br>
                        solids, but there are no official guidelines that govern <br>
                        what can be called “semisweet.” Semisweet chocolate falls <br>
                        somewhere between bittersweet chocolate and sweet dark <br>
                        chocolate. This type of chocolate is most commonly used for <br>
                        baking, but it’s important to follow the recipe to  <br>
                        determine whether it calls for semisweet, bittersweet,<br>
                        or baking chocolate.</p>
