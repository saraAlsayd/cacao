        <h2>the history of chocolate</h2>
        <p>Chocolate’s 4,000-year history began in ancient Mesoamerica,
            present day Mexico. It’s here that the first cacao plants were found.
            he Olmec, one of the earliest civilizations in Latin America,
            were the first to turn the cacao plant into chocolate.
            They drank their chocolate during rituals and used it as medicine.
            Centuries later, the Mayans praised chocolate as the drink of the gods.
            Mayan chocolate was a revered brew made of roasted and ground cacao seeds mixed with
            chilies, water and cornmeal. Mayans poured this mixture from one pot to another,
            creating a thick foamy beverage called “xocolatl”, meaning “bitter water.”</p>

        <h2>The health benefits of chocolate</h2>
        <p>Cocoa also contains flavonoids and flavonols that prevent cell damage and
            inflammation, as well as promote blood health. Chocolate’s health benefits come from
            cocoa– not added fillers or sugars – so the key is choosing a treat that has 
            the highest percentage of cocoa.</p>
        <p>If you ever need a reason to eat chocolate,
            ask neurophysiologist and wellness coach Will Clower,
            Ph.D., a guest speaker at Cancer Wellness at Piedmont
            he can give you plenty of them. “Chocolate is the perfect metaphor for how healthy
            people eat,” says Clower. When eaten in control, chocolate has numerous health 
            benefits, says Dr. Clower.
            It functions as an antibiotic and an anti-platelet (similar to aspirin),
            increases HDL (“good”) cholesterol, decreases LDL (“bad”) cholesterol
            and contains polyphenols that prevent DNA damag</p>

        <h2>How to select the healthiest chocolate</h2>
        <p>In its unprocessed state, chocolate is slightly bitter and acidic,
            which is why many chocolate manufacturers add sugar and other fillers
            to raise its pH level to neutral. Unprocessed or “raw” chocolate is better for you,
            says Dr. Clower, so look for these key words on the label, as well as the percentage
            of cocoa or cacao the treat contains.
            “The higher the percentage of cocoa, the more you can have of it,
            ” he explains. “Low-cocoa chocolates are high in sugar and fillers,
            so those are the things to absolutely avoid.”
            A chocolate bar with 85 percent cocoa, for example,
            has less sugar than milk chocolate varieties and more heart-healthy cocoa butter.
            As a bonus, richer dark chocolate is usually more satisfying,
            meaning you can eat less.
